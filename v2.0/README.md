# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

## Pre-requisites

```shell
npm install @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
```

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts

// to get solidity-coverage
npx hardhat coverage
```
